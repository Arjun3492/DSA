# Introduction to Binary Search Trees (BST)

Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental data structure used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It is a binary tree where the left child of a node contains elements less than the node's value, and the right child contains elements greater than the node's value. This arrangement allows for fast searching similar to a binary search algorithm.

## Key Properties

1. **Binary Tree Structure**: Each node has at most two children, referred to as left and right child.
2. **Ordering Property**: For every node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node.
3. **Unique Elements**: No duplicate elements are allowed in a BST,(but if we want duplicates we can have each node as a pair of value and frequency of that value).
4. **Inorder Traversal**: Inorder traversal of a BST is sorted in ascending order.

## Operations on Binary Search Trees

### Insertion

To insert an element into a BST, we start at the root and compare the value with the current node. If the value is less than the current node, we move to the left child; if it's greater, we move to the right child. We repeat this process until we find an empty spot where the new node can be inserted.

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void insert(TreeNode *&root, int val) {
    if (!root) {
        root = new TreeNode(val);
        return;
    }
    if (val < root->val)
        insert(root->left, val);
    else
        insert(root->right, val);
}
```

### Searching

Searching in a BST is similar to insertion. We start from the root and compare the target value with the current node. If they match, we return true. If the target is less than the current node, we search in the left subtree; if it's greater, we search in the right subtree. We continue this process until we find the element or reach a null node.

```cpp
bool search(TreeNode *root, int target) {
    if (!root) return false;
    if (root->val == target) return true;
    if (target < root->val)
        return search(root->left, target);
    else
        return search(root->right, target);
}
```

### Deletion

Deletion in a BST is a bit more complex as it requires maintaining the BST properties after removal. There are several cases to consider:
- Node to delete is a leaf node.
- Node to delete has one child.
- Node to delete has two children.

```cpp
TreeNode* minValueNode(TreeNode* node) {
    TreeNode* current = node;
    while (current && current->left)
        current = current->left;
    return current;
}

TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (!root) return root;
    if (key < root->val)
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    else if (key > root->val)
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    else {
        if (!root->left) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        else if (!root->right) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        TreeNode* temp = minValueNode(root->right);
        root->val = temp->val;
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}
```

Binary Search Trees are powerful data structures that facilitate efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Understanding the algorithms involved is crucial for utilizing BSTs effectively in various applications.
